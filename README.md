# GameHub

Project for LSU's CSC 3380 course, Object Oriented Design

Built in Ruby on Rails using a PostgreSQL database, this website is meant to act as a forum where people can discuss indie game development, as well as a job board and project management site where people can collaborate with other small developers or free-lance developers and manage all the different people working on their project all in one place.
